## Particle Physics for Babies, Toddlers & Children

With this activity, we aim to lower the barrier to entry for particle physics, showing that it's not "rocket science" and can be shared with children of all ages. This also aims to highlight role models for underrepresented categories in the field.

### When / where

#### Upcoming editions

   * FunLab at the Trafford Center, 2026 (info coming soon)

#### Past editions

   * Universally Manchester festival, 2024 (link to be added)


### General Ideas & Logistics
*   **Engagement**: Scientists talk to parents while children play with particle physics-themed material.
*   **Play Area**: A set of stations for younger and older children to learn through play.
*   **Books**: A dedicated book-reading corner.
*   **Role Models**: A table featuring materials about women and mothers in STEM at different career stages, in collaboration with the University of Manchesterparents' network.

### Activities by Age Group

#### Babies and Toddlers (1.5 - 3.5 years): Tuff Tray & Sorting
*   **Tuff Tray**: A sensory play area helping children (and parents) learn:
    *   Particle names through colourful plastic balls and pom poms.
    *   How the strong force works, through extendable fidget toys.
    *   How we do data analysis, with toy computers and keyboards. 
    *   How a black hole works, with a funnel and a big bouncy ball. 
*   **Sorting Activity**:
    *   Sorting colourful balls (representing different particles) with different characteristics into containers.
*   **Ball pit**:
    *   Finding "new physics" in a ball pit that contains both plastic balls and other kinds of balls representing new physics phenomena
    *   Only 2 children at a time can be in the ball pit, but it's a lot of fun!

#### Children (3.5+ years): Discover the Higgs Boson
*   **Megablocks Construction**: Reproduce the Higgs boson discovery plot using Duplo or Megablocks.
*   **Collaborative Game**: Multiple stations for collaborative play.
*   **Coloring**: Black and white prints for coloring to take home.

### Books & Photo Corner
*   **Books Corner**: Featuring books like "Particle Physics for Babies" (written by Louie Corpe) and "Neural Networks for Babies" to serve as conversation points.
*   **Photo Corner**: "Take a picture with the LHC" backdrop.
