The SMARTHEP Training Network is an Innovative Training Network bringing together scientists from the four major collaborations of the LHC at CERN, training Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) to drive the development of Real-Time analysis together with key specialists from computer science and industry ([www.smarthep.org](http://www.smarthep.org)).

As part of the SMARTHEP outreach hackathon that has taken place in June 2024, the SMARTHEP ESRs prepared videos in all of the network languages (English, Spanish, German, Thai) for the HEPscape! HEP-themed escape room created by INFN researchers.

The first release of the English HEPscape! video can be found on Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/14575672](https://zenodo.org/records/14575672).
