I am a professor of particle physics at the University of Manchester, after my education and previous career steps in Italy, UK, Switzerland and Sweden.

I am working on the [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern) experiment at the [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider). My research focus is uncovering the nature of Dark Matter, a kind of unknown matter constituting 85% of the matter in the universe. My research has been driven by the challenges related to the "big science" needed to study the fundamental constituents of matter at the LHC. The vast amount of data produced by the LHC, and the even larger and more complex datasets prospected for future colliders, present the perfect research environment requiring novel computing, AI and ML tools.

I work with my group of Master's, PhD students and postdoctoral researchers supported by the [European Research Council](https://erc.europa.eu) and [UKRI](https://www.ukri.org), and I coordinated the [SMARTHEP](https://www.smarthep.org) European Training Network on real-time analysis enabled by ML and heterogeneous computing architectures.

My research is founded on Open Science and sustainability for software and AI/ML in both the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible) and environmental contexts. I am a member of the [ESCAPE](https://projectescape.eu) (European Science Cluster of Astronomy & Particle Physics ESFRI), a work package lead of [EVERSE](https://everse.software) (European Virtual Institute for Research Software Excellence) and the co-organizer of the FAIR and environmentally sustainable AI working group within [EuCAIF](https://eucaif.org) (European Coalition for AI in Fundamental Physics).
